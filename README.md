# Slyce
This demo creates animated cross sections from a video using WebCodecs, [mediabunny](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny), and Canvas. One row of pixels is sampled from each frame. Canvas dimensions are set based on frame count and are also adjustable via settings.

# Development
The project uses Vite as a build tool. During development, use `npm run dev` to launch the Vite server. 

# Deployment
This project includes a GitHub action that builds the frontend and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
