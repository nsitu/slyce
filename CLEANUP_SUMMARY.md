# Cleanup Summary - Threading Architecture Simplification

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Successfully removed support for `basis_encoder_threads.wasm` and related threading detection code. The codebase now exclusively uses the single-threaded `basis_encoder.wasm` running inside multiple web workers managed by `KTX2WorkerPool`.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Simplified `src/utils/wasm-utils.js`
- **Removed:**
  - `getWasmThreadingDiagnostics()` function
  - `checkIsWasmThreadingSupported()` function
  - `threadingSupported` constant and export
  - All console logging about threading diagnostics
  - SharedArrayBuffer detection code

- **Kept:**
  - `getOptimalThreadCount()` function (still used for worker pool sizing)
  - `optimalThreadCount` export

### 2. ✅ Simplified `src/modules/load_basis.js`
- **Removed:**
  - `threadingSupported` import
  - Conditional logic choosing between threaded/non-threaded versions
  - Threading-related console logs

- **Changed:**
  - Always loads `./wasm/basis_encoder.js` (single-threaded version)
  - Updated comments to reference architecture documentation

### 3. ✅ Simplified `src/modules/ktx2-encoder.js`
- **Removed:**
  - `threadingSupported` import
  - `optimalThreadCount` import
  - `multithreading` setting from constructor
  - Conditional threading logic

- **Changed:**
  - Always calls `basisEncoder.controlThreading(false, 1);`
  - Added comment: "Always use single-threaded mode (parallelism handled by worker pool)"

### 4. ✅ Updated `src/workers/ktx2EncoderWorker.js`
- **Removed:**
  - `threadingSupported` and `optimalThreadCount` imports
  - References to "threaded encoder not compatible with workers"

- **Changed:**
  - Updated comments to reference architecture documentation
  - Changed comment to: "Single-threaded mode (parallelism is managed by the worker pool)"

### 5. ✅ Updated `src/workers/ktx2EncoderTest.js`
- **Removed:**
  - `threadingSupported` and `optimalThreadCount` imports
  - `threadingSupported` and `threadCount` from test response data
  - Threading compatibility warnings

- **Changed:**
  - Updated comments to explain single-threaded usage
  - Simplified console output

### 6. ✅ Removed Cross-Origin Isolation Support
- **Deleted:**
  - `public/coi-serviceworker.js` file

- **Updated:**
  - `index.html` - removed `<script src="./coi-serviceworker.js"></script>` line

### 7. ✅ Updated `src/utils/memory-utils.js`
- **Removed:**
  - `threadingSupported` and `optimalThreadCount` imports
  - `threadingSupported` from `getMemoryInfo()` return object
  - `sharedArrayBufferSupported` check

### 8. ✅ Updated `src/utils/user-agent-utils.js`
- **Removed:**
  - `getWasmThreadingDiagnostics` import
  - `threadingDiagnostics` from diagnostics object
  - `hasSharedArrayBuffer` from diagnostics object

### 9. ✅ Updated `src/utils/ktx2-worker-test.js`
- **Removed:**
  - Reference to multithreading in JSDoc
  - Threading info from console output

### 10. ✅ Updated Documentation
- **Updated:** `public/wasm/readme.md`
  - Added comprehensive "Threading Architecture" section
  - Explained why single-threaded encoder in worker pool approach was chosen
  - Documented all challenges with threaded encoder
  - Listed all files with their usage status
  - Noted that threaded files are kept for reference but not used

## Files Kept for Reference (Not Used)
- `public/wasm/basis_encoder_threads.js`
- `public/wasm/basis_encoder_threads.wasm`

## Files Actively Used
- `public/wasm/basis_encoder.js` (single-threaded encoder)
- `public/wasm/basis_encoder.wasm` (single-threaded encoder)
- `public/wasm/basis_transcoder.js` (transcoder for Three.js)
- `public/wasm/basis_transcoder.wasm` (transcoder for Three.js)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Simpler Codebase:** Removed ~200+ lines of conditional logic and diagnostics
2. **Easier Deployment:** No need for cross-origin isolation setup
3. **Better Maintainability:** One clear path instead of multiple code branches
4. **Clearer Architecture:** Worker pool pattern is explicit and well-understood
5. **Fewer Dependencies:** Removed service worker polyfill dependency

## Build Status
✅ No errors detected after cleanup

## Next Steps for Testing

- [ ] Verify encoding still works on all platforms
- [ ] Check that worker pool creates correct number of workers
- [ ] Ensure performance is equivalent to before
- [ ] Test on both localhost and GitHub Pages deployment
- [ ] Verify on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

## Architecture Notes

The current architecture uses:
- **Single-threaded** `basis_encoder.wasm` for encoding
- **Multiple Web Workers** managed by `KTX2WorkerPool` for parallelism
- **Worker Pool Size** determined by `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` (capped at 18)

This provides equivalent performance to the threaded encoder without the complexity of:
- Cross-origin isolation requirements (COOP/COEP headers)
- SharedArrayBuffer support checks
- Nested worker coordination issues
